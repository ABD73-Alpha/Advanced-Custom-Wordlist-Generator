# 🔐 Advanced_Custom_Wordlist_Generator

A custom wordlist generator built for ethical hacking, CTFs, and penetration testing engagements. This tool creates highly targeted password lists based on information about the target, such as names, organizations, years, and more. It supports leetspeak transformations, symbol combinations, and common password mangling techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Combine up to 5 custom words (e.g. names, orgs, years, numbers)
- Insert special characters: `_`, `@`, `-`, `.`, or nothing
- Apply leetspeak (e.g. `a` → `@`, `e` → `3`, `s` → `$`)
- Append common suffixes (e.g. `123`, `!`, `@2024`)
- Supports upper/lower/mixed case combinations
- Optionally include a fallback wordlist like `top_10k_passwords.txt`
